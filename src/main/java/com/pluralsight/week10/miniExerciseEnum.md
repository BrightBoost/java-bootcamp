1. Create an enum for user roles
2. Add the values: USER, ADMIN and EDITOR
3. Create a User class, give it a username and a user role (the type of your enum)
4. Give it a method `printRole` that prints the enum
5. Give it another method `printPermissions` that has either a switch statement or an if and prints the permissions. Here are the options:
    - You are a user. Don't break the application please.
    - You are an admin. Be responsible.
    - You are an editor. Be creative.
